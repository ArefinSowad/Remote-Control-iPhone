## Remote control iPhone from computer
Using a **BLUETOOTH** mouse, or keyboard, or game controller, it’s possible to remotely control any iPhone from a device with a web browser.

Requirements: A **BLUETOOTH** mouse, or keyboard, or game controller. The device controlling it must have at least a web browser. If the controlling device doesn't support Bluetooth but does support a usb wireless connection (like most wireless mouses), you may be able to use a dongle to connect to your phone, but I haven't tested it.

⭐❓

1. Go to Settings > Accessibility > Touch > AssistiveTouch, and enable AssistiveTouch
2. Scroll down to pointer devices and open the devices tab. Select Bluetooth devices, put your mouse and/or keyboard into pairing mode, and pair it to your phone.
4. Disable the following settings: Always Show Menu, Dwell Control
5. If also using a bluetooth keyboard, disable 'Show Onscreen Keyboard', otherwise disable it.
6. If using a game controller, enable 'Use Game Controller', otherwise disable it.
7. If you've done everything correctly you should now be able to wirelessly control your phone. Now for screen mirroring.

For screen mirroring, you have 2 options. I could list every single pro and con but let me make it very simple: for higher resolution but worse latency, choose the AirPlay method. For better latency but limited to 720p, choose the website method.

**Website method**:
1. Download [this](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/screen-mirroring-app/id1463795505) app on your phone
2.  On your device with a web browser, open [mirroring.tv](https://mirroring.tv).
3.  Scan the QR code shown using the Screen Mirroring app on your phone, and select watch ad
4.  Though not required, an [Adblocker](https://cdn.adguard.com/public/Dns/adguard-dns.mobileconfig) is highly recommended. (Google how to install configuration profiles if you don't know how.)
5.  Press the settings icon in the app and disable Super Mode.
6.  Select Screen Mirror, then broadcast.
7.  After 3 seconds, you should see your screen show up on the browser, and be able to control it using your mouse. Congratulations your done!

**AirPlay method**:
1. On your computer, download any AirPlay app. For Windows I’d recommended [this](apps.microsoft.com/detail/9n4ks6nzwr6q).
2. In your phones control center, select screen mirroring, and choose your computer.
3. You should see your phone screen show up and be able to control it using your mouse. Congratulations you're done!
